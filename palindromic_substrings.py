# Given a string s, return the number oÆ’ Palindromic substrings in Â¡t.
# A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
# A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.
# Example 1:
# Input: s = "abc"
# output: 3
# Explanation: Three palindromic strings: "a", "b", "c",
# Example 2:
# Input: s = "aaa"
# output: 6
# Explanation: Six palindromic strings: "a", "a", "a", "aa", "aa", "aaa".
